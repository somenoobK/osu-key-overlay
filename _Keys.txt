's_' for shift
'c_' for control
'a_' for alt
'e_' for enter
'__' for space
'|' for \
'n(number)' for numpad keys
'n(+-/*)' for numpad operator keys

for everything else use the same character as the key

function keys are not added(because i don't think anybody uses them .3.")
if you want to add them, got to config.py and add the key character and and its virtual key code in kcd dictionary
